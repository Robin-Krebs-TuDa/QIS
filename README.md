# Quantum Information Science 2023/24

This is the github repository for the QIS course 2023/24 at TU Darmstadt. <br>
Code relevant to the course will be uploaded and maintained here.

## Distillation Protocols

Interactive notebooks for entanglement distillation. The Mathematica version and the Jupyter version are provided by the Quantum Computing group, the Matlab version was authored by Thomas Duchac.  
All three versions cover the same material.

### Installation
#### Mathematica version
Should work with any Mathematica installation out of the  box.

#### Matlab version
Matlab will automatically open an installation dialogue in case of missing dependencies.

#### Jupyter version
The only dependency is `sympy`. It can be installed by typing in a terminal:
```
pip install sympy
```
Or, using the requirements.txt file with:
```
